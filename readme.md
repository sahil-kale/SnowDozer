# Teleoperated Snow Plow

## Background
In Jan 2019, I had just started to drive to school rather than take the bus. This meant I had the added responsibility of shoveling the snow before taking my car out every morning. After having to wake up early for 3 days, I decided that a solution using a robot could be operated. The objective was simple: create a robot that could shovel a driveway.

## Specifications
- FPGA Processor with 2 encoders, ultrasonic sensors and limit switches used
- 2.4 GHz Wifi Channel for Command & Control Packets and live visual feed
- 1-axis camera gimbal for the operator to see the surroundings
- PWM & CAN motor controllers used to send signals
